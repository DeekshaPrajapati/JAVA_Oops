package Array;
/*
Array is a collection of homogeneous (similar) data types.
Array is a object, because here using a new keyword.
Array ki super class object class hoti he.
Array heap memory ki andar memory occupie karta he.
java ke andar all  object heap memory ke andar storage hote he.

int a[] =new int[9];
int b[] =new int[0];
int c[]=new int[-3]; // its not valid showing exception of negative array size exception.

                         Advantages
 Array is fast compare to primitive data type.
 In a array storing a object.

                         Disadvantages
 Array of the size are fixed, and the run time of the program not incress or decress of the size array.
 so many chances of the memory wastages.
 In a array only store a similar data type.
 when i removing any element in a array so again perform terversing so, that array performance are slow.
