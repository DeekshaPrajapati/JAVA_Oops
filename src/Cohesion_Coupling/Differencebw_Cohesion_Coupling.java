    //1.)  Cohesion is the concept of intra-module.       1.) Coupling is the concept of inter-module.
    //2.)  Cohesion represents the relationship within    2.) Coupling represents the relationships between modules.
    //     a module.
    //3.)  Increasing cohesion is good for software.      3.) Increasing coupling is avoided for software.
    //4.)  Highly cohesive gives the best software.       4.) Whereas loosely coupling gives the best software.
    //5.)  Cohesion is created between the same module.   5.) Coupling is created between  two different modules.
