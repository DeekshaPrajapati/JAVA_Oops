/*
The Hashtable class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values.
Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value. To successfully store and retrieve objects from a
hashtable, the objects used as keys must implement the hashCode method and the equals method.

Features of Hashtable

It is similar to HashMap, but is synchronized.
Hashtable stores key/value pair in hash table.
In Hashtable we specify an object that is used as a key, and the value we want to associate to that key. The key is then hashed, and the resulting hash code is used as the index at which the value is stored within the table.
The initial default capacity of Hashtable class is 11 whereas loadFactor is 0.75.
HashMap doesnâ€™t provide any Enumeration, while Hashtable provides not fail-fast Enumeration.

/*
HashTable Constructor=> 1.Hashtable()

 2.Hashtable(int initialCapacity): This creates a hash table that has an initial size specified by initialCapacity and
 the default load factor is 0.75.

 3.  Hashtable(int size, float fillRatio):

 4.Hashtable(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m): This creates a hash table that is initialized with the elements in m.
