package Collection.Set;
/*
Set Interface in Java is present in java.util package.
It extends the Collection interface.
It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items.
We can store at most one null value in Set.
Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
 */

/*

Set can be instantiated as:

Set<data-type> s1 = new HashSet<data-type>();
Set<data-type> s2 = new LinkedHashSet<data-type>();
Set<data-type> s3 = new TreeSet<data-type>();

/*
  Set Methods

  2.The addAll() method appends all the elements of the specified collection to the set.
  3.The clear() method removes all the elements from the set.
  4.The contains() method is used to know the presence of an element in the set.
  Its return value is true or false depending on the presence of the element.
  5. The containsAll() method is used to check whether all the elements of the collection are available in the existing set or not.
  6. The  hashCode() method is used to derive the hash code value for the current instance of the set.
     It returns hash code value of integer type. (Ya sabhi element ko addition karke interger me o/p dedega)
  7. The isEmpty() method is used to identify the emptiness of the set
  8. The remove() method is used to remove a specified element from the Set.
