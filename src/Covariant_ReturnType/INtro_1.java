    jab differnt class ke andar same method ke return type different hote he to ussa covariant return type bolte he.

    The covariant return type specifies that the return type may vary in the same direction as the subclass.

    Before java 5 version hum method ke return type ko chage nhi kar sakte tha, but After java 5 version method ka return type ko
    hum different ho sakte he.

    Before Java5, it was not possible to override any method by changing the return type. But now, since Java5, it is possible to override method by changing the return type
    if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes its return type to subclass type.
