    // Data hiding is a technique of hiding internal object details, i.e., data members. It is an object-oriented programming technique.
    // Data hiding ensures, or we can say guarantees to restrict the data access to class members. It maintains data integrity.
    // Data hiding means hiding the internal data within the class to prevent its direct access from outside the class.
    // Data hiding also helps to reduce the system complexity to increase the robustness by limiting the interdependencies between software components.
    // Data hiding is achieved by using the private access specifier.
    //Data hiding only hides class data components.
