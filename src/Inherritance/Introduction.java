    // How to achive inheritance?
    // By using extends keyword

    // Inheritance ko IS-A relation bhi bolte he.

    // Why use inheritance in java
    //For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
    //For Code Reusability.

    //*******************TYpes of inheritance************************
    //When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.
    //When one class inherits multiple classes, it is known as multiple inheritance.
    //When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance.


    //Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?
    //To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

    //Example :- Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes.
    // If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object,
    // there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
